If we draw $n$, we have 0 chance of getting the successive ticket.\r(c) $\\Pr = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{1 \\le i \\le n}{\\frac{n-i}{n}}$: to see this, note that once we have selected the $i$-th number, we have $\\frac{n-i}{n}$ chance to draw a larger number. We multiply each of these probabilities by $\\frac{1}{n}$–the probability of drawing the first card–and sum.\r(d) 1. $\\Pr = \\frac{1}{n(n-1)}$\r2. $\\Pr = \\frac{1}{(n-1)^2}$\r3. $\\Pr = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{1 \\le i \\le n}{\\frac{n-i}{n-1}}$\r5)\r(a) Number of pairs is $52 \\times 51$\r(b) $\\Pr = \\frac{4}{52}\\cdot\\frac{51}{51} = \\frac{1}{13}$: only interested in the top card here, we can count quite easily.\r(c) The symmetry argument is as given on Sakai, giving $\\Pr = \\frac{1}{13}$. Or, we could count: drawing a tree diagram gives $\\Pr = \\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{3}{51} + \\frac{12}{13}\\cdot\\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{1}{13}$.\r(d) $\\Pr = \\frac{1}{13}\\cdot\\frac{3}{51} = \\frac{3}{663} = \\frac{1}{221}$\r(e) Letting $A$ be the event that the first card is an ace, $B$ the second, and $C$ both, the desired probability is $\\Pr(A \\cup B \\cup C) = \\frac{1}{13} + \\frac{12}{13}\\cdot\\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{99}{663} = \\frac{33}{221}$. Alternatively, $\\Pr = 1 - \\frac{12}{13}\\cdot\\frac{47}{51} = 1 - \\frac{564}{663} = \\frac{33}{221}$\r7)\r(b) Let $A$ be the event that the first die is less than or equal to 3, and $B$ the second. Then we want $\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\frac{1}{2^2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\r(c) Here, we must either have $(3,x)$ or $(x,3)$ with $x \\le 3$. We can count the number of such pairs with $2\\cdot3 = 6$; then $\\Pr = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6}$ since there are $36$ total pairs. Alternately, we can count $\\Pr = 2\\cdot(\\frac{1}{6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{6}$ with symmetry.\r\r1.3:\r1) Let $x$ be my portion, $y$ that of my friend, and $z$ that of my neighbor. Then we have \\begin{cases}\rx + y + z = 1 \\\\\rx = 2y \\\\\ry = 2z\r\\end{cases} But $z = 1-x-y$, so $y=2-2x-2y=2-2(2y)-2y \\iff y = \\frac{2}{7}$. Then $z = \\frac{2}{14}$ and $x = \\frac{4}{7}$.\r4)\r(a) If the coin is not heads both times, the subset is $\\Omega \\setminus \\{2\\} = \\{0,1\\}$\r(b) One toss is heads: $\\{1\\} \\subset \\Omega$\r(c) This we cannot model as a subset of $\\Omega$ because we cannot embody information about the order of the events in the integers given.\r(d) At least one heads: $\\{1,2\\} \\subset \\Omega$\r7)\r(a) $\\Pr(1) = \\Pr(6) = \\frac{p}{2}, \\Pr(2\\cdots5) = \\frac{1 - p}{4}$ (assuming that face 1 & 6 are equally likely, and 2-5 are equally likely).\r(b) $\\sum_{3 \\le i \\le 6}{\\Pr(i)} = 3\\cdot\\frac{1-p}{4} + \\frac{p}{2} = \\frac{3-p}{4}$\r8) (For this problem I assumed $\\Pr(AB) \\equiv \\Pr(A \\cap B)$\r(a) $\\Pr(A \\cup B) = \\Pr(A) + \\Pr(B) - \\Pr(A \\cap B) = 1-0.2 = 0.8$\r(b) $\\Pr(A^C) = 1-0.6 = 0.4$\r(c) $\\Pr(B^C) = 1-0.4 = 0.6$\r(d) $\\Pr(A^C \\cap B) = 0.2$ (easy to see if we draw a Venn diagram)\r(e) $\\Pr(A \\cup B^C) = 0.8$ (idem.)\r(f) $\\Pr(A^C \\cap B^C) = \\Pr((A \\cup B)^C) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$\r9)\r(a) $\\Pr(F \\cup G) = 0.9$ by the inclusion-exclusion formula\r(b) $\\Pr(F \\cup G \\cup H) = 1$ (idem., though a Venn diagram helps)\r(c) $\\Pr(F^C \\cap G^C \\cap H) = 0.1$ (idem.)\r$\\textit{N.B.}$ Venn diagrams to be found at end.\r\r1.4:\r1)\r(a) Cannot be determined; we don't know the population size.\r(b) True; the overall proportion is a weighted average of $88\\%$ and $92\\%$ and therefore is between the two.\r(c) True; the \"weights\" in the average are then evenly distributed ($0.5,0.5$).\r(d) True; letting the weights be exactly 3-to-1 gives $91\\%$, and tipping the ratio in favor of the women only increases the percentage.\r5)\r(a) Tree diagram at end.\r(b) idem.\r(c) $\\Pr(B) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{17}{35}$\r8) $\\Pr(W \\mid B) = \\frac{5}{7}$. To see this, note that the conditional probability informs us we only care about the $50\\%$ b/w and the $20\\%$ black. So now 5 of 7 cards is b/w. This also comes directly from the formula.\r10)\r(a) $\\Pr(0) = 0.6 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.3 ; \\Pr(1) = 0.4 \\cdot 0.5 + 0.6 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.5 ; \\Pr(2) = 0.4 \\cdot 0.5 = 0.2$\r(b) $\\Pr(\\text{enough power}) = \\Pr(0)\\cdot0 + \\Pr(1)\\cdot0.6 + \\Pr(2)\\cdot1 = 0.5$\r11)\r(a) Using the tree diagram, $\\Pr = \\frac{p}{2} + \\frac{1-p}{4}$\r(b) $\\Pr = \\frac{1-p}{4}$ \r(c) $\\Pr = \\frac{\\frac{1-p}{4}}{\\frac{p+(1-p)}{2}} = \\frac{1-p}{2}$\r(d) $\\Pr = \\frac{\\frac{1-p}{4} + \\frac{p}{2}}{\\frac{p+(1-p)}{2}} = \\frac{1+p}{8}$"
