Find $\\Pr(A)$\nCalculate $\\Pr(A^C)$; then $\\Pr(A) = 1 - \\Pr(A^C)$\nNow note that our outcome space $\\Omega$ has cardinality $365^{50}$ (since each event can be represented as a 50-tuple). We are interested in a subset of this, $A^C$; namely, the tuples having no repeated elements. This subset is counted by $\\binom{365}{50}50!$ (Why? First we choose the 50 slots, then we must arrange them in some order).\nSo, $\\Pr(A) = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{365}{50}50!}{365^{50}}$"
