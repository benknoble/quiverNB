King Djoser (Step Pyramid = funerary complex)\n - Combined elements of Early Dynastic period in different ways\n - One functional entrance out of fourteen\n - Originally a square like Abydos, but then enlarged with more squares to a height of ~60m\n - Crescent-shaped stairs related to kingly rituals incoporated into pyramid complex\n - Walls indicated concepts of power and authority; also divinity\n - Lots of symbols of eternity and perpetuality\n - Represent divine life, limits of rule\n - Identified by Horus name; adorned with regalia\n - Body proportioned to be kingly, but also relatively accurate\n - *Sed*-festival, renewal of kingship\n - Contained both a burial chamber and a cultic funerary temple\n - Seated statue of king similar to Khasekhem's statues\n - Not meant for mortal viewing, but for the *ka* of the king to benefit from the ritual performed in the *serdab*\n - King stands on 'nine bows', traditionally the enemies of Egypt\n - Also contains name of Imhotep\n\n**Fourth Dynasty**\n1. Superstructure step complex becomes true, smooth-walled pyramid\n2. No longer North/South eternal ritual site; instead, East/West linear sequence from Pyramid to *ka*\n3. Change likely directly connected to increased emphasis of kings connection to Sun god\n4. Pyramid shape is symbol of sun, relating to sacred *benben* stone in Heliopolis\n5. Funerary complex moved from northern side (stars) to easter side (sun)\n6. Kings began to call themselves 'son of Ra'\n7. At death, the king no longer performed eternal rituals of kingship but joined Ra in eternal cycle of renewal\n8. Note, this did not preclude the king also being a manifestation of Horus\n9. Sneferu (Pyramid at Meidum)\n - Only building was small funerary temple\n - Causeway led from temple to valley temple next to cultivation\n10. Bent Pyramid at Dashur (def. Sneferu)\n - Angle of faces changes partway up\n - Somewhat different: causeway led from north (not east) to monumental temple in the desert (not edge of cultivation)\n - Considerable use of resources to build\n - Carved procession of female offering-bearers stress the importance of supplying the dead with food and offerings\n - Likely served both as a record of estates and a supply for *ka* in case the cult ceased\n - Carved sides of niches housed *ka* and recieved offerings\n - King stands between earth and sky, or embraced by various deities\n11. Khufu (successor; built Great Pyramid at Giza)\n - Fairly typical; fine stone\n12. Radjedef (successor; built ar Abu Rawash)\n - Little left\n13. Khafra (successor; built Second Pyramid at Giza)\n - Includes Sphinx\n - Various types/colors of stones\n - More elaborate funerary temple included many elements that became standard in Fifth and Sixth Dynasties\n - Some somewhat-intact statues illustrate the dislike of repetition in Egyptian craft\n - One impressive intact statue shows far-reaching authority\n\n###Non-royal Tombs\n\n1. Third Dynasty elite built *mastabas* at Saqqara\n2. Wooden panels sometimes served to perpetuate existence of deceased and provide necessary offerings\n3. Standing, advancing officials holding staff and sceptre became standard in funerary art\n4. Reversal of hieroglyph direction important\n5. Also contained statues for *ka*\n6. Fourth Dynasty tombs also experienced 'everyday life scenes'\n\n###Conclusion\nThird Dynasty forms a link between formative early dynasties and classic pyramid age starting in Fourth\nRoyal tombs diverged from elite tombs, which stuck to older forms and gained the everyday life scenes\nGap between royal and elite greatest during Fourth Dynasty"
