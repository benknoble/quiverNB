Fertile Crescent (people began really exploiting animals and plants: may have led to population increase)\n- Why did that happen? What sparked the change from hunter-gatherer to settlement\n- Egypt settles down around 6000 B.C. (esp. in delta areas), which is comparatively late\n- Site survey (map sites)\n- Region survey (like a trash line--walk lines (transects) together and count/collect artefacts)\n- Can't trace development of urbanization in Egypt because of the landscape: Narrow plain of agriculture fertility\n- Floodplains; Inundation; Nile--systematic and regular; alluvium? deposition--dense rock and dirt makes excavation difficult\n- Burial sites/Pyramids--large bodies of records and text--in the desert (saves them)\n- Material culture and interpretation derives from necropolis rather than actual living cities\n- Burial grounds on high ground, west desert facing east"
