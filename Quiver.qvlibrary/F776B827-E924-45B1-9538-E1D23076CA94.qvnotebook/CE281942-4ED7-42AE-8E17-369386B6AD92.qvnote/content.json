(one of the easiest distinctions between cultures is languages)\n  - Leads to **Origin**: Human invention/innovation\n  - **Acquisition**: Cultural transmission/learning\n  - *Pinker* disagrees\n- He (and Chomsky) argue for a psychological phenomenon\n  - **Origin**: Biological adaptation\n  - **Acquisition**: Innate component of the human mind; a successive reinvention (language instinct)\n\n### Written vs. Spoken Language\n\nWe will primarily focus on **spoken** language (primary manifestation of our capacity)\n**Written** is a more recent idea, resting on spoken\nLater, might examine their relationship\n\n## The Language \"Instinct\"\n\nPinker\n> Language is an instinct to acquire an art\n\nChomsky\n> Human beings have an innate language faculty\n\nTwo versions of **nativism**: innate language (endogenous rather than exogenous)\n  - Comes easily, almost involuntarily\n  - \"Drive to speak\"\n\n### Innate vs. Learned\n\nLanguages are **acquired**\nWhat language(s) you end up speaking depends on your linguistic environment\nNot clear that acquisition process is *properly* learning (consider e.g. the development of the visual system)\n\n### Innateness\n\nAdmits of *degrees*, i.e. a spectrum\nInnate to the degree that it is shaped primarily by internal mechanisms\nLearning mechanisms: *generalized* and *conscious*\nInnate mechanisms: *specialized* and *unconsciously*\n\n### Evidence for Innateness\n\nEloquent nonsense vs. Unspoken intelligence\nNo known examples of communities (isolated or otherwise) without a complexly expressive langauge\nUbquity of language\nCreole Languages (children improving it AND children inadvertently recreating it)\n  - *pidgin*--precursor to Creole\nBroca's Aphasia: connects areas of brain to language production, much in same way as different lobes\n  - localization of brain function (Broca/Wernicke's areas)"
