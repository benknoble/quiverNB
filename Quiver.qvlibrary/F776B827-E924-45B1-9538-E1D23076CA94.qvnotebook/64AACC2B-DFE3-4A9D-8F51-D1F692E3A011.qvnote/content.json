DCS\n2. Analog Systems\n\nLanguage seems to be the only one with syntax\nConventional answer:\n> Adaptation: evolved as a result of selective pressures in the domain communication\n\nNon-conventional: Exaptation!\n\n# Lexical Protolanguage\nEarly stage of human language\nLexical protolanguage: hypothesis that this stage was lexical items without syntax or functional vocabulary\n\n## Bickerton: LP\nContinuity Paradox--discontinuity between human language and animal communication systems vs. physical neurological continuity\n**Syntax** is not just word order\nDid not evolve from a functionally referential system\nLanguage evolved primarily as a system of representation (communication is secondary)\nCritical precursors were conceptual\n\n### Features of LP\nVocal Learning\nLexical Items\nMotivation to share information\n\nMissing: Syntax\n- Grammatical items\n- Phrase Structure\n- Argument Structure\n- Null Elements\n- Varied Word Order\n\n### Living Fossils\nFeature of PL that we find in contemporary linguistic behavior\nChild language (early stages)\n\n### Catastrophic Syntax\nSaltational theory of syntax: didn't emerge gradually\nRecursion doesn't come in degrees\nModeled on rapid childhood development of syntax and creole-pidgin transition\nCorroboration from archaeological record"
