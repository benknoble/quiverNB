Performance\nWhat speakers *know* (1) v. how it is *employed* (3)\nCompetence is only **one** factor in the speaker's overall performance, among attention, memory, motor control, perceptual systems, &c.\n\n# Phrase Structure\n\nThe Generative Structure of Language\n\n## Levels of Structure\n\nPhonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics\n\n## Linear Structure?\n\nAre sentences just strings of words? No (tree structure)\nIf so, we could generate sentences with a lexicon and a set of sequencing rules\n\n## Evidence for Non-Linear Structure\n\n### Structural Ambiguity\n\nThe same sequence of words can take on different meanings, depending on how they are grouped (and NOT because a specific word is ambigous)\n\nE.g. \"Juggling cats can be amazing.\"\n\n### Structure Dependent Rules\n\nQuestion formation:\n\n1) The boy *is* happy.\n2) *Is* the boy \\_\\_ happy?\n3) The boy who *is* eating ice cream *is* happy.\n4) \\* *Is* the boy who \\_\\_ eating ice-cream is happy?\n5) *Is* [the boy who is eating ice-cream] \\_\\_ happy?\n\nCan't formulate the rule linearly\n\n### Long-distance Dependencies\n\nTransitive verbs require a direct object\n\n6) John fixed [the bicycle].\n7) \\* John fixed.\n\nBUT sometimes the relationship to the direct object is not linear\n\n8) Did John tell Mary he fixed [the bicycle]?\n9) \\* Did John tell Mary he fixed \\_\\_?\n10) [Which bicycle] did John tell Mary he fixed \\_\\_?"
