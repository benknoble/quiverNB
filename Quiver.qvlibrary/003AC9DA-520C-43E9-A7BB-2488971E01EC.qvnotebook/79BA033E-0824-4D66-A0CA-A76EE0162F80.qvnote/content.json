We have the expected cost at $\\sum_{1 \\le i \\le \\lg{n}}{c_i \\cdot i}$ for all $c_i \\ge 2$.\n\nWhile I was unable to use this to come up with a strong guess (other than perhaps $n^{\\lg{n}}$), the master theorem does tell us that $T(n) \\in \\Theta(n^{\\lg{3}})$, so I will use that and the substitution method. From the proof below, it is evident $n^{\\lg{n}}$ would have worked as well, despite being less tight.\n\nIgnoring floors:\n\nSo, we wish to prove $\\exists c \\gt 0, d : \\forall n \\gt 0 : T(n) \\le cn^{\\lg{3}} + dn$ by induction on $n$. We assume the base case $T(1) = 1 \\le c + d$, we have that constraint on $c,d$.\n\nAssume that $\\forall k \\lt n : T(k) \\le ck^{\\lg{3}} + dk$.\nThen $T(n) = 3T(\\frac{n}{2}) + n \\le 3(c\\left({\\frac{n}{2}}\\right)^{\\lg{3}} + \\frac{dn}{2}) + n$ by the induction hypothesis\nSo $T(n) \\le \\frac{3cn^{\\lg{3}}}{2^{\\lg{3}}} + \\frac{3dn}{2} + n = cn^{\\lg{3}} + dn + n\\frac{d+2}{2} \\le cn^{\\lg{3}} + dn$ when $\\frac{d+2}{2} \\le 0$, or $d \\le -2$.\n\nThen choose $d=-2, c=3$.\n\n$T(n) \\le 3n^{\\lg{3}} - 2n \\in O(n^{\\lg{3}})$\n\nQ2. $T(n) = T(\\frac{n}{2}) + n^2$\n\nFrom the recursion tree, we have the sum $\\sum_{1 \\le i \\le \\lg{n}}{(n + \\frac{n^2}{2^i})} \\in O(n^2)$ if we unroll (we have something like $n\\lg{n}$ and $n^2\\sum_{1 \\le i \\le \\lg{n}}{\\frac{1}{2^i}} = n^2 (2 - \\frac{2}{n}$).\n\nSo we will prove $\\exists c \\gt 0 : \\forall n \\gt 0 : T(n) \\le cn^2$ by induction on $n$. \nThe base case gives $T(1) = 1 \\le c$.\n\nAssume that $\\forall k \\lt n : T(k) \\le ck^2$.\nThen $T(n) = T(\\frac{n}{2}) + n^2 \\le \\frac{cn^2}{4} + n^2$ by the induction hypothesis.\nThen $T(n) \\le n^2 \\left( \\frac{c}{4} + 1 \\right) \\le cn^2$ when $c \\ge \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nSo choose $c = \\frac{4}{3}$. Then $T(n) \\le \\frac{4}{3}n^2 \\in O(n^2)$."
