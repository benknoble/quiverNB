The two unioned sets are context free, as expressed by the production sets:\n\\begin{align}\nS &\\to aSb \\\\\nS &\\to A \\\\\nA &\\to aA \\\\\nA &\\to a\n\\end{align}\nand\n\\begin{align}\nS &\\to aSb \\\\\nS &\\to B \\\\\nB &\\to bB \\\\\nB &\\to b\n\\end{align}\n\n2. Show that $L = \\{ wcwcw : w \\in \\{a,b\\}^* \\}$ is not context-free.\n\nAssume $L$ is context-free.\n\nLet $L' = L \\cap \\mathcal{L}(a^*ca^*ca^*)$. Since $\\mathcal{L}(a^*ca^*ca^*)$ is regular, $L'$ is context-free.\n\nNow consider $w = a^nca^nca^n \\in L'$, where $L' = L(G)$ for some context-free grammar $G=(V,\\Sigma,R,S)$ and $n \\gt \\frac{\\phi(G)^{\\mid V - \\Sigma \\mid}}{3}$. $w$ must have some representation $uvxyz$ such that one of $v,y$ is non-empty and $\\forall i: uv^ixy^iz$ is in $L'$.\n\nBut now, either $vy$ contains at least one $c$ and some (possibly zero) $a$s, such that $uv^2xy^2z \\not\\in L'$ (since there would be $\\geq 3$ $c$s), or $vy$ contains only $a$s, such that $uv^2xy^2z$ no longer has the form $\\sigma c \\sigma c \\sigma : \\sigma \\in \\mathcal{L}(a^*)$ because there is no such $\\sigma$ that could satisfy the imbalance of $a$s distributed accross the string; $\\therefore uv^2xy^2z \\not\\in L'$.\n\nBut this shows that $L'$ is not context-free by the pumping lemma, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore $L$ is not context-free.\n\n3. Show that $L = \\{a^mba^nba^p : m=n \\lor n=p \\lor p=m \\}$ is or is not context-free.\n\nLet $MN = \\{a^mba^mba^*\\}, NP = \\{a^*ba^nba^n\\}, PM = \\{a^pba^*ba^p\\}$. Clearly, $L = MN \\cup NP \\cup PM$. Thus if each of these languages is context free, so is $L$.\n\nWe construct a grammar for each language by specifying the productions (the alphabets are trivial to see). We will reuse the following production in each one:\n\\begin{align}\nA^* &\\to A^*a \\\\\nA^* &\\to a\n\\end{align}\n\n$MN$:\n\\begin{align}\nS &\\to XbA^* \\\\\nX &\\to aXa \\\\\nX &\\to b\n\\end{align}\n\n$NP$:\n\\begin{align}\nS &\\to A^*bX \\\\\nX &\\to aXa \\\\\nX &\\to b\n\\end{align}\n\n$MN$:\n\\begin{align}\nS &\\to aSa \\\\\nS &\\to bA^*b\n\\end{align}\n\nThus $L$ is context free."
