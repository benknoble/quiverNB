Clearly, however, $A'$ is regular, since it is the union of 2 regular languages. Since regular languages are closed under the Kleene Star, $A'^*$ is regular. Alternatively, $\\mathcal{L}((a^4 \\cup a^9)^*) = A'^*$, so $A'^*$ is regular and accepted by the given regular expression.\n\nIt remains to show that $A^* = A'^*$. The idea here is to show that the elements of $A'$ are sufficient to generate the elements in $A$, and thus in $A^*$.\n\nFirst, note that $A = \\{ a^{b^2} : b \\ge 2 \\}$. Further, note that $2$ and $2+1=3$ are relatively prime. Thus so are $2^2$ and $(2+1)^2=3^2$.\nThen, $\\forall m : \\exists p,q : m = 2p + 3q$.\nFurther, $\\forall m \\ge m_0 : \\exists p,q \\ge 0 : m = 2^2p + 3^2q = 4p + 9q$.\n    These statements are extensions to BÃ©zout's Identity (cf. [2]).\n    We want $p,q \\ge 0$ since the Kleene star implies that we take a non-negative number of the elements in the set it is applied to.\nIf we can find $m_0$, we can show that $\\forall n \\lt m_0 : a^n \\in A^* \\iff a^n \\in A'^*$ and $\\forall n \\ge m_0 : a^n \\in A^* \\iff a^n \\in A'^*$. Since the statement will then hold for all $n$, we will have shown $A^* = A'^*$.\n\nFrom [1], $m_0 \\leq (2^2 - 1)(3^2 - 1) = 24$, which is in this case tight.\nThat is, the following statements show that $\\forall m \\ge 24 : \\exists p,q \\ge 0 : m = 4p + 9q$.\n$24 = 6 \\cdot 4$\n$25 = 4 \\cdot 4 + 9$\n$26 = 2 \\cdot 4 + 2 \\cdot 9$\n$27 = 3 \\cdot 9$\n$\\forall n \\ge 28, \\exists o \\in \\{24,25,26,27\\}, \\exists q : n = o + 4q$\n\nWith our $m_0$ in hand, we can complete the proof as follows.\n\n$\\forall n \\lt 24 : a^n \\in A^* \\iff a^n \\in A'^*$\nThis holds because the $n$ such that $a^n \\in A^*$ are $\\{0,4,8,9,12,13,16,17,18,20,21\\}$, or the (possibly empty) sums of the form $4p + 9q$. One can easily verify for each such $n$ that $a^n$ must be in both sets $A^*$ and $A'^*$. Since $n = 4p + 9q$, we simply take combinations of $a^4$ and $a^9$ (possibly empty). These are both elements of $A$ and $A'$, so all such $a^n$ are in their starred forms.\n\nFormally, take any $a^n \\in A'^*, n \\lt 24$. Then $n$ must be a combination of $4,9$ such that $n = 4p + 9q$, and it must be in the set enumerated above. It is easily verified that each of these has the desired form. Further, $a^n \\in A^*$ since $\\{a^4,a^9\\} \\subset A \\subset A^*$.\nNow take any $a^n \\in A^*, n \\lt 24$. Once more, $n$ must be in the set enumerated above, each of which can be expressed as a combination of $4,9$. Thus $a^n \\in A'^*$.\n\n$\\forall n \\ge 24 : a^n \\in A^* \\iff a^n \\in A'^*$\nWe have already show that any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ in this range can be written as a sum $n = 4p + 9q$. As above, we take combinations of $a^4$ and $a^9$ from $A'$ to generate $A'^*$. From $A$, we have more options; e.g., for $a^{25}$ we can simply take $a^{25} \\in A$. For $a^{50} \\in A^*$, we take $a^{25}a^{25}$. However, we can generate all such $a^n \\in A^*$ with combinations of elements in $A'$.\n\nFormally, take any $a^n \\in A'^*, n \\ge 24$. By definition of $A'^*$, $\\exists p,q \\ge 0 : n = 4p + 9q$. We have already shown that this holds $\\forall n \\ge 24$. But any combination of $4,9$ is also in $A^*$, since $\\{a^4,a^9\\} \\subset A \\subset A^*$.\nNow take any $a^n \\in A^*, n \\ge 24$. Once more, we can show that $n$ is a combination of $4,9$, not because $a^4,a^9$ are the only elements of $A$ but because we have already shown that $n \\ge 24$ must have such a property. Thus such an $a^n$ must also be in $A'^*$, whose elements are only the combinations of $a^4,a^9$.\n\nThus $A^* = A'^*$ and $A^*$ is regular since $A'^*$ is regular. $\\square$\n\nNotes\n\nI drew heavily on [1] for my construction of this proof.\n[1]: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/95414/proving-that-0m2-mid-m-geq-3-is-regular\n[2]: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2056267/proof-that-any-number-can-be-represented-as-the-sum-of-two-relatively-prime-numb"
