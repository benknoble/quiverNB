At least 2 examples.\n$\\Sigma = \\{a,b\\}$\n(d) $\\{ w : \\exists u \\in \\Sigma^* : www = uu \\}$\n\n    Some strings in this set would be\n        $aa$, since $aaa \\in \\Sigma^*$ gives $u = aaa, www = aaaaaa = uu$\n        $abab$, since $ababab \\in \\Sigma^*$ gives $u = ababab, www = abababababab = uu$\n    Strings not in this set would be\n        $ab$ since $www = ababab$ which can not be divided into two equal substrings\n        $abba$ since $www = abbaabbaabba$ which can not be divided into two equal substrings\n        \n2. Simplification of regular expressions.\n(a) $b^* \\cup a^* \\cup (a \\cup b)^*$\n\nThis is equivalent to $(a \\cup b)^*$ since never choosing an $a$ (or $b$) yields a string in the second (or first) element of (a).\n\n(b) $((a^*b^*)^*(b^* \\cup a^*)^*)^*$\n\nFirst, note that this is equivalent to $((a^*b^*)^*(b \\cup a)^*)^*$ if we remove redundant stars.\nSecond, note that $(a^*b^*)^*$ is equivalent to $(b \\cup a)^*$.\n    The first is the repetition of the pattern \"any number of as followed by any number of bs.\" Since we are allowed to choose 0 as or 0 bs at any stage, we can generate any string in $\\{a,b\\}^*$. That is, $\\mathcal{L}((a^*b^*)^*) = \\mathcal{L}(a^*b^*)^* = (\\{a\\}^* \\circ \\{b\\}^*)^* = \\{a,b\\}^*$\n    The second is the repetition of the pattern \"an a or a b.\" Since we are allowed to choose as or bs at any step along the way, the language is also $\\{a,b\\}^*$. That is, $\\mathcal{L}((b \\cup a)^*) = (\\{a\\} \\cup \\{b\\})^* = \\{a,b\\}^*$\nThen $((a^*b^*)^*(b \\cup a)^*)^*$ is equivalent to $((b \\cup a)^*)^* = (b \\cup a)^*$\n\n3. Let $\\Sigma = \\{a, b, c\\}$. Write a regular expression for the set of all strings in $\\Sigma^*$ such that the sum of the number of a’s and b’s in the string is at most two. Thus the string can have an a and a b but cannot have two a’s and a b, for example.\n\n$c^* \\cup (c^*(a \\cup b)c^*) \\cup (c^*(a \\cup b)c^*(a \\cup b)c^*)$"
