We add an edge $(v_1,v_2)$ between some $v_1 \\in G_1$ and some $v_2 \\in G_2$, connecting the two graphs. The resulting graph is still planar, no matter which planar graphs and vertices we choose.\n> A: ...did not decide\n\n> Q: True or False: Consider these two digraphs G1 and G2. G1 and G2 are isomorphic... that is, the same nodes and edges other than labeling.

If the graph has any odd vertices, no EC. If the graph has all even vertices, at least one EC.\n2. More than 2 odd vertices, no EP. Exactly 2 odd vertices, at least one EP starting on one and ending on the other\n3. The sum of the degrees of all vertices is even (twice $\\lvert E \\rvert$). The number of odd vertices is even\n\nNot constructive: it can verify existence but not construct\n\n## Algorithm\nWorst case linear time\nYou can see the powerpoint or the book for the algorithm (we aren't going over it in class)\n\nTopology...\n\n# Hamiltonian Paths/Circuits\n**Hamiltonian Path** is a path in the graph that passes through every *vertex* once\nSimilarly, a **Hamiltonian Circuit** is a Hamiltonian Path that ends where it starts\n\nIcosian game is a game based on this type of circuit (for which one exists!)\n\n5 Platonic solids that produce Hamiltonian Graphs\n(d20, d12, d8, d6, d4): See ppt\n\n## Algorithms and theorems for Hamiltonian Graphs\nHarder, for some reason\nSufficient conditions:\n- Dirac (1952): simple graph with $N$ vertices is H. if degree of each vertex $\\ge \\frac N 2$\n- Ore (1960): \"\" if for every pair of non-adjacent vertices the sum of their degrees is $\\ge N$\n\n# P vs NP\nNo *known* efficient algorithm for finding HP/HC\nEP/EC is linear worst case\n\n\"Efficient\" means polynomial (even $n^2$, compared to $2^n$)\n\nWe have *not* yet ruled out the existence of such an efficient algorithm\n\nWe can easily *verify* a given path/circuit as H. or not\n\nTraveling Salesman Problem"
