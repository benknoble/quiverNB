      "data": "We investigated the application of 2D kinematics models to projectile motion.\n\nWe began with the following model: a particle is launched at a constant initial speed $v_0$ at angle $\\theta$ above the horizontal, from an initial height $h$ above the ground.\nWe sought to predict the range $R$ and time of flight $T$ for the particle.\n\nFrom application of trigonometric principles and the definition of $x_f$ given by kinematics: $$v_0 = v_0\\cos\\theta\\bar{i} + v_0\\sin\\theta\\bar{j}$$ and $$x_f = x_0 + v_{0x}t + \\frac{a_x}{2}t^2$$\nSince range is simply the horizontal distance traveled, we can define $$R = x_f - x_0 = T \\cdot v_0 \\cos\\theta$$ if we take the particle's initial position to be $x_0 = 0$.\n\nNoting that $R$ depends on $T$, we can derive $T$ from the second dimension $y$. We let $y_0 = 0$ and $y_f = h$. Kinematics tells us that $$y_f - y_0 = h = v_{0y}T + \\frac{a_y}{2}T^2$$\nSolving the resultant quadratic equation for $T$ and substitutng for $v_{0y}$ gives $$T = \\frac{v_0\\sin\\theta + \\sqrt{v^2_0\\sin^2\\theta + 2gh}}{g}$$\n\nThis predicts a dependence between $T$ and $v_0, \\theta, h$, and thus a dependence between $R$ and these quanitites as well. If we can accurately measure these quantities, we expect the theoretical model to give an accurate $(T,R)$ to compare against experimental results."

      "data": "A ball is placed inside a projectile launcher and launched repeatedly at the same angle from the same height.\nThe launch angle is set to $\\theta = 70^{\\circ} \\pm 1^{\\circ}$ using a plum-ball and angle ticks on the launcher.\nThe initial height is measured from the landing plate to the lip of the launcher by meter stick at $107.5 \\pm 0.5\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nOnce the launch plate is position, a smart timer measures the time from launch to striking the plate with uncertainty $0.002\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe meter stick measures the range with precision $.002\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nOur theory suggests that $(T,R)$ depends on the height $h$, angle $\\theta$, and initial velocity $v_0$. Further, $R \\propto T \\cdot v_0 \\propto v_0^2$ and $v_0$ is rather difficult to measure. We approximate the instantaneous $v_0$ by an average $\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$. We take several measurements and use statistical methods to obtain a reasonable $v_0$, which we then use to predict $(T,R)$.\n\nA photogate and timer at the end of the launcher is used to measure time $\\Delta t$ taken to travel a very short distance $\\Delta x$ at the beginning of the launch--we perform these measurements at the horizontal angle 0 degrees in order to minimize the effects of gravity. The uncertainty of the time measurements is taken to be $0.001\\mathrm{s}$ based on the instruments.\nDistance between photogates is measured with a meter stick with an uncertainty of $0.2\\mathrm{cm} = 0.002\\mathrm{m}$ due to the width of the photogates. We measure $\\Delta x = 10.0\\mathrm{cm} \\pm 0.2\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nWith our measured data in hand, we predict $(T,R)$ from the equations above (using $g=981\\mathrm{\\frac{cm}{s^2}}$) and compare against the measured values."
