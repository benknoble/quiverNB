A derived geometric relation dependent on diameter $D$ and width $L$ of each disk is compared to a linear model based on constant linear accleration $a$ of hanging masses $m$ attached to disks with different radii ($r$) allowed to fall through a height $h = 0.74\\mathrm{m}$:\n\\begin{align}\nI_{geometric} &= \\frac{M\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^3{L_iD_i^4}}{8\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^3{L_iD_i^2}} \\\\\nm(g-a)r &= I\\frac{a}{r} + \\tau_f\n\\end{align}Analyzing this model using a least-squares linear regression yielded $I = (0.01337 \\pm 0.00048)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2}$, which agreed with $I_{geometric} =  (0.0116 \\pm 0.0028)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2}$ to within uncertainties (computed via quadrature), confirming the relation between the two theories. Included is a discussion on the frictional torque $\\tau_f = (0.0074 \\pm 0.0025)\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$ and the relative contributions of each of the 3 disks to the total moment of inertia. The report concludes that the geometric prediction of $I$ agrees with results observed during experimentation."

      "data": "## II. Introduction\n\nCiting the Lab Activity:\n\n*An object in motion maintains a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. Similarly, an object that is rotating will continue to rotate at a constant angular velocity unless acted upon by an external torque. The rotation of an object about a fixed axis, described by its angular acceleration $\\alpha$, is determined by the object’s rotational inertia $I$ (also called moment of inertia) and the torques $\\tau$ that are applied. The fundamental relationship between these variables is Newton’s 2nd Law for rotation: $\\tau_{net} = I\\alpha$*\n\nWe begin with this relationship to investigate a specially-constructed disk apparatus and its moment of inertia $I$. The apparatus consists of three disks of varying sizes (medium, large, and small) attached through the center in that order. The material is of uniform density $\\rho$ and has total mass $M$. The apparatus rotates quasi-freely (there is measurable friction) about the center.\n\nWe also have hanging masses of known size attached to strings, calipers, stopwatches, and a meter stick, all used for measuring various properties of the system.\n\n### Theoretical Background\n\nThe moment of inertia, the quanity we are interested in computing for this apparatus, is typically defined"

      "data": "Wishing to verify this computation experimentally, we return to the relationship $I = \\frac{\\tau}{\\alpha}$.\n\nVarious masses are hung on each of the three wheels and allowed to fall through a predetermined height $\\Delta{h}$ (measured by meter stick to within 1 cm). 3 stopwatches record the average time interval $\\bar{\\Delta{t}}$ of each fall (to an uncertainty determined via standard error). As we shall see in the Analysis, this is sufficient to compute $I$. In effect, this allows us to compute a linear acceleration, from which we can derive angular acceleration, and relate to the torque via our relationship above (cf. Image II).\n\nAdditionally, we note that the disks are measured by fitting calipers to the apparatus. For many measurements, it was simple enough to fit the calipers, and the resulting uncertainty is $\\frac{1}{40}\\mathrm{in}$ based on the division of the instrument. However, for the diameters, we were often not able to full fit the calipers and had to rely on estimation techniques with impromper fit and addition of several smaller measurements, reducing our uncertainty to $\\frac{1}{10}\\mathrm{in}$. You may note that the uncertainties in the data are presented in meters, and thus maintain more significant figures than usual; this is due to the conversion from inches."

      "data": "We begin with the geometrical computation of the wheel, as in the Theoretical Background. Measurements for $L,D$ and their uncertainties are summarized in Table I. \n\nMass, as printed on the apparatus, is taken to be $M = 4.92 \\pm 0.02$kg.\n\nComputing $I$ using units of meters and kilograms throughout gives\n\\[\nI_{apparatus} = (0.0116 \\pm 0.0028)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2} = (0.0089, 0.0144)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2}\n\\]where the last component is written as an open interval, and the uncertainty is rounded to 2 significant figures.\n\nThe uncertainty in $I$ is computed via quadrature of the original geometric equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sigma_I}{I} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_M}{M}\\right)^2 + \\sum{\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_L}{L}\\right)^2 + 16\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{D}\\right)^2 \\right]} + \\sum{\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_L}{L}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{D}\\right)^2 \\right]}} \\\\\n= \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_M}{M}\\right)^2 + \\sum{\\left[2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_L}{L}\\right)^2 + 20\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{D}\\right)^2 \\right]}}\n\\]with sums over the disks. This result comes from the uncertainty for the general power law. We use quadrature here because the interaction between the various variables in the sum is quite complex and would require extensive analysis for an upper-lower bound. The quadrature result, while involved, is simpler in the long term.\n\nNext, we investigate the contribution of each disk to the total $I$. The results, summarized in Table II, are calculated as follows:\n\\begin{align}\n\\rho &= \\frac{4M}{\\pi\\sum{LD^2}} \\\\\nM_i &= \\rho V_i = \\frac{MD_i^2L_i}{\\sum{LD^2}} \\\\\nI_i &= \\frac{1}{2}M_iR_i^2 = \\frac{ML_iD_i^4}{8\\sum{LD^2}} \\\\\nRelativePercent(I_i) &= \\frac{I_i}{I} \\cdot 100\n\\end{align}As an example:\n\\[\nRelativePercent(I_1) = \\frac{4.92\\mathrm{kg}(0.0254\\mathrm{m})(0.0762\\mathrm{m})^4}{(8(0.0254\\mathrm{m}(0.0762\\mathrm{m})^2 + 0.0254\\mathrm{m}(0.15494\\mathrm{m})^2 + 0.0254\\mathrm{m}(0.05334\\mathrm{m})^2))0.0116\\mathrm{kgm^2}} \\cdot 100 \\\\\n= 5.45\n\\]We continue with the second calculation of $I$, computed from the acceleration data. For each mass $m$ and wheel of radius $r = \\frac{D}{2}$, we are able to determine the linear acceleration $a$ from kinematics equations, yielding\n\\[\na = \\frac{2\\Delta{h}}{(\\bar{\\Delta{t}})^2}\n\\]This measurement is crucial because we can measure the torque on the apparatus as $\\tau_{string} = Tr$ (where $T$ is the tension in the string).\nUsing Newton's Second Law,\n\\[\n\\tau_{string} = m(g-a)r\n\\]Now, we have already observed that there is measurable friction in the rotation of the apparatus; it exerts a torque $\\tau_{f}$ opposing the rotation. So\n\\[\n\\tau_{net} = I\\alpha = \\tau_{string} - \\tau_{f} \\iff \\tau_{string} = I\\alpha + \\tau_{f}\n\\]But we also know that $a = \\alpha{r}$ from rotational kinematics:\n\\[\n\\tau_{string} = I\\frac{a}{r} + \\tau_{f}\n\\]Equating the results gives\n\\[\nm(g-a)r = I\\frac{a}{r} + \\tau_{f}\n\\]where we recognize the form of a linear relationship $y = mx + b$ letting\n\\begin{align}\ny &= m(g-a)r \\\\\nm &= I \\\\\nx &= \\frac{a}{r} \\\\\nb &= \\tau_{f}\n\\end{align}With these results in mind, we are ready to apply an analysis of the data of $\\Delta{t}$ (used to compute $a$), $r = \\frac{D}{2}$, and $m$ to experimentally determine $I$ and $\\tau_{f}$.\n\nAs described above, the linear acceleration of the wheel (and thus the mass) is proportional to angular acceleration: $a_{\\perp} = \\alpha{r}$ (from rotational kinematics). We measured acceleration by measuring the height of the fall and the time it took. We took 3 time measurements for each trial, and then compute\n\\begin{align}\na &= \\frac{2\\Delta{h}}{(\\bar{\\Delta{t}})^2} \\\\\n\\sigma_{\\bar{\\Delta{t}}} &= \\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta{t}}}{\\sqrt{3}}&\\text{(Standard Error)} \\\\\n\\sigma_a &= a\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta{h}}}{\\Delta{h}}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\bar{\\Delta{t}}}}{\\bar{\\Delta{t}}}\\right)^2}&\\text{(Quadrature)}\n\\end{align}Quadrature is an appropriate choice here for its relative simplicity and its explicit analysis of the interaction of variables.\n\nA summary of the data is presented in Table III, with Table IV containing the original times. Below we present an extended example.\n\\begin{align}\na &= \\frac{2(0.74\\mathrm{m})}{\\left(\\frac{1.95\\mathrm{s} + 1.97\\mathrm{s} + 1.73\\mathrm{s}}{3}\\right)^2} &= 0.417\\mathrm{\\frac{m}{s^2}} \\\\\n\\sigma_{\\bar{\\Delta{t}}} &= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{(1.95-1.883)^2 + (1.97-1.883)^2 + (1.73-1.883)^2}{3-1}}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\mathrm{s} &= 0.77\\mathrm{s} \\\\\n\\sigma_a &= (0.417\\mathrm{\\frac{m}{s^2}})\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{0.01}{0.74}\\right)^2 + 4\\left(\\frac{0.077}{1.883}\\right)^2} &= 0.035\\mathrm{\\frac{m}{s^2}}\n\\end{align}Armed with this acceleration data, we now plot $m(g-a)r$ v. $\\frac{a}{r}$ as described. Chart I presents the data points, along with a linear trendline with equation $y = 0.01337x + 0.0074$. The correlation coefficient is $R^2 = 0.99$ from Excel. Using Excel's $\\textit{LINEST}$ function, we find that\n\\begin{align}\n\\sigma_m &\\sim \\sigma_I &= 0.00048 \\\\\n\\sigma_b &\\sim \\sigma_{\\tau_{f}} &= 0.0025\n\\end{align}From this analysis, we can conclude\n\\begin{align}\nI &= (0.01337 \\pm 0.00048)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2} &= (0.01289,0.01385)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2} \\\\\n\\tau_{f} &= (0.0074 \\pm 0.0025)\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m} &= (0.0049,0.0099)\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}\n\\end{align}This is supported above where we were able to see a possible linear relationship between $m(g-a)r$ and $\\frac{a}{r}$, with slope $I$ and y-intercept $\\tau_f$."

      "data": "We first compare our computed geometric value of $I$ with the value of $I$ computed from measured accelerations:\n\\begin{align}\nI_{geometric} &= (0.0116 \\pm 0.0028)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2} &= (0.0089, 0.0144)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2} \\\\\nI_{measured} &= (0.01337 \\pm 0.00048)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2} &= (0.01289,0.01385)\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2}\n\\end{align}Since the interval for $I_{measured}$ is completely contained within that for $I_{geometric}$, we find that the values agree to within uncertainty. This confirms (at least from one perspective) our theoretical analysis above.\n\nNext, we examine the results of the relative percentage of each disk's moment of inertia $I_i$. Unsurprisingly, the largest disk contributes the most to the total moment of inertia. What is surprising, however, is just how large that contribution is: $93.24\\%$ of $I$ comes from the large middle disk, greater than a plausibly expected $\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 66.7\\%$. This is likely because of the powers involved in circumference and volume formulas (which form part of the $RelativePercent$ equation); the ratios of $\\left(\\frac{D_2}{D_1}\\right)^4 = 4.14$ and $\\left(\\frac{D_2}{D_3}\\right)^4 = 8.44$ indicate that the middle disk contributes more than the other disks.\n\nWe turn our attention now to the $y$-intercept of Chart I. As described in the analysis, we equate this value to the torque produced by friction, $\\tau_{f} = (0.0074 \\pm 0.0025) \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$. The value is relatively small by comparison with the torque from hanging masses (as otherwise they wouldn't have fallen), indicative partially of the small radius at which the friction acts (compared to the radii of the disks) and partially of the small value of the friction force, allowing the disk to rotate quasi-freely.\n\nAs an example, for trial 1 (eliding uncertainties),\n\\[\n\\tau_{string} = m_1(g-a_1)r_1 = (0.1\\ \\mathrm{kg})(9.8-0.417)\\ \\mathrm{\\frac{m}{s^2}}\\ (0.07747\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 0.073\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}\n\\]which is an order of magnitude greater than $\\tau_{f}$.\n\nAn important consideration missing from our analysis is the impact of individual uncertainties in the accelerations ($\\sigma_a$), not accounted for by the least-squares linear regression model used to compute the line of best fit from which we extracted $I$ and $\\tau_{f}$. However, we note that the two \"sides\" of the equation related by the graph include $aR$ and $\\frac{a}{R}$, whose combined uncertainties under quadrature are exactly the same:\n\\[\n\\sigma_{vertical} \\approx \\sigma_{horizontal} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_a}{a}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_R}{R}\\right)^2}\n\\]The vertical and horizontal errors differ only by a term of $\\sigma_R^2 \\ll \\sigma_a^2$, so the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in $a$. In fact,\n\\[\n\\sigma_{vertical} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_R^2 + \\sigma_{horizontal}^2}\n\\]since $\\sigma_{\\frac{a}{R}} = \\sigma_{aR}$.\n\nIn the end, we can expect this to increase the uncertainties calculated for $I$ and $\\tau_{f}$, but as the data points plotted are what are relevant to the line of best fit, we expect that $I$ and $\\tau_f$ are relatively unchanged by the inclusion of these uncertainties; that is, we expect the values to continue to agree as presented above. To that end, we present a second chart (Chart II) with the error bars, computed as described above (the precise values may be found in Table V). It is easily seen that an upper-lower bound for the uncertainty of the slope could become quite large--still agreeing with the computed value.\n\nIn conclusion, we reiterate that our theory provides an accurate prediction of the moment of inertia of a multi-disk apparatus that, at first glance, seems difficult to analyze. With the aid of basic physical principles, both of mass and of kinematics and torque, we were able to arrive at different definitions of $I$ that agree in experiment. The exploration proved useful in learning to analyze complex, non-symmetric objects, revealing that such non-symmetry is perhaps even more pronounced than suspected (cf. relative contributions to moment of inertia). We note that further explorations might make use of more precise measuring and timing apparatus to further improve the bounds on $I$ both geometrically and experimentally; in particular, the values of $L$ and $D$ contribute to a large uncertainty in $I_{geometric}$ and could be improved upon (perhaps by removing the disk from its stock), while uncertainty in $a$ contributes largely to the uncertainty of $I_{measured}$."
