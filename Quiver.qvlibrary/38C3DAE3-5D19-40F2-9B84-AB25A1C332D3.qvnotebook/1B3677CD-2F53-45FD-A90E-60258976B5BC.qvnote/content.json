      "data": "## Experimental Methods\n\nFrom the lab description:\n\nA projectile is launched at ground level and lands on the ground again downrange. The distance (range) from the launch point to the landing point is perfectly flat and horizontal. Identical projectiles are launched repeatedly at the same angle $\\theta$ but with different initial speeds $v_0$, and their rangers $R$ and times-of-flight $T$ are measured. The goal is to use the data to empirically find the launch angle of the projectile and its uncertainty.\n\n## Analysis\n\nData for the projectile speeds, range, and time is given in Table I below. The uncertainties are as follows:\n\n- Speeds: $\\pm 2 \\mathrm{\\frac{m}{s}}$\n- Ranges: $\\pm 5 \\mathrm{m}$\n- Times of flight: $\\pm 0.1 \\mathrm{s}$"
