Suppose we have a set of orthogonal vectors $\\{ q_1 \\dots q_n \\}$ such that $\\forall i, \\forall j, i \\neq j \\implies q_i \\cdot q_j = 0$ (this is the definition of orthogonality). Each $q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n(a) Suppose $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. We claim $v = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_iq_i$ for some $c_1, \\dots c_n, c_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Find these $c_i$.\n\nFurther, what is the formula if $\\forall i \\mid q_i \\mid = 1$ ?\n\nNotes:\n\nLet $\\mathcal{Q} = \\{ q_1 , \\dots , q_n \\}, C = (c_1 \\dots c_n), v = (v_1 \\dots v_n)$\n\nThen we seek $C$ such that $v = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_iq_i$.\n\nThe claim is equivalent to the statement that any $n$ orthogonal vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ spans $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (which is itself a generalization of a statement, which applies to any vector space). This claim is known to be true.\n\nThere are two perspectives:\n\n1) Consider $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ a matrix, where the rows are the vectors given.\n$$Q = \\matrixstart q_{11} & \\cdots & q_{1n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ q_{n1} & \\cdots & q_{nn} \\matrixend$$\n\nFurther, consider $C,v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ as column vectors.\n\nThen the truth of the claim implies $v = QC$. Matrix operations tell us that $Q^{-1}v = Q^{-1}QC = IC = C$ if $Q^{-1}$ exists. However, $Q$ must be invertible--its rows are linearly independent (since they are all orthogonal). This is known as the invertible matrix theorem. The wikipedia page on \"Invertible matrices\" has more information, including general solutions to the computation of $Q^{-1}$.\n\nThen $C = Q^{-1}v$.\n\n2) Consider that any such $Q$ as a matrix can be reduced to $Q' = I$ via elementary row operations. This is also a result of the invertible matrix theorem. Each $q_i'$ has magnitude 1 and a 1 in the $i$th position.\n\nThen $v_i = c_i' q_i' = c_i' (0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0)$, and so $v_i = c_i'$. Then $v = Q'C'$, a similar result as above. Of course, this implies $v = IC'$ and that $C' = v$.\n\nNow, each $q_i'$ is a linear combination of all $q_i$ (a similar statement is true for $Q^{-1}$), and so the constants $C$ can be computed from $Q$.\n\nWe call $C$ the coordinate of $v$ in $\\mathcal{Q}$ written $[v]_\\mathcal{Q}$ where $Q[v]_\\mathcal{Q} = v$\nFurther, $[v]_\\mathcal{Q} = Q^{-1}v = C$."
