One or more digital inputs\n2. One or more digital outputs\n3. A spec that details the value of each output for every possible combination of valid input values\n4. A timing spec that (at minimum) details an upper bound $t_{pd}$ on the time this circuit will take to produce the output value\n\n`pd` means \"propagation delay\"\n\n### Combinational Digital System\niff\n1. Each primitive circuit element is combinational\n2. Every input is connected to exactly one output (or directly to a source of digital information)\n3. There are no cycles (and hence no feedback yet)\n\n## Noise Margins\nKey idea: Keep 0s distinct from 1s\nUse the min voltage and high voltage to represent 0/1\nFor reliability, we outlaw \"close calls\"\n\n## Elements and Conventions\nClean/restore input (buffer) (triangle)\ncomplement input (not) (triangle - circle)\nand (round box)\nor (round arrow)\nxor (barred or)\nhave names and symbols\n\n## Common Tech\nCMOS\n- transistors (switch)\nN-type: conduct when control is 1\nP-type: conduct when control is 0\n\nThese switches can control when current flows (ON $\\neq$ 1!)\n\n### Silicon\nTransistors are built from it\nPure Si itself does not conduct well, so we add impurities for conductivity\nAs provides free electrons (n-type)\nB provides free holes (p-type)"
