This enables a better approximation, but requres the computation of the partials $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$. And of course, further orders require more ridiculousll-complex partials.\n\nRunge-Kutta 2\n\n$k_1 = f(t_n,y_n)$\n$k_2 = f(t_n + \\frac h 2, y_n + \\frac h 2 k_1)$\n$y_{n+1} = y_n + hk_2$\nReuses previous information to compute the next step to give error $O(h^2)$"
