      "data": "$y'' + ay + by = 0$ is a second order ODE. It is linear, homogenous, and has constant coefficient. The IVP has initial conditions $y(t_0) = y_0, y'(t_0) = y'_0$\n\nThen we get roots $r_1,r_2$ from $r^2 + ar + b = 0$ and then $y(t) = c_1e^{r_1t} + c_2e^{r_2t}$, where we solve for $c_1,c_2$ using the initial values as constraints.\n\nBecause this is solvable $\\forall y_0, y'_0 \\iff W \\neq 0$ and we find that $W = 0 \\iff r_1 = r_2$, the equation for $y(t)$ is solvable at $t_0$ if and only if (iff, $\\iff$) $r_1 \\neq r_2$ (for $W$ is the Wronskian).\n\nIf $r_1 = r_2$, you have only half a fundamental set (but that's for another set).\n\nFirst, what if $r_1,r_2$ are complex?\n\nPre-first, the manipulation of complex numbers $z$.\n\n$\\sqrt{-4} = \\pm2i$\n\n$(1 + i)(2 + i) = 2 + 3i + i^2 = 1 + 3i$\n\n$\\frac 1 i = \\frac i {i^2} = \\frac i {-1} = -i$\n\nDivision: multiply by the conjugate of the denominator and simplify.\nFor any complex number $z$, it has a conjugate $z^* = \\bar{z}$ such that the product $zz^* = {\\Re z}^2 + {\\Im z}^2$ where $\\Re z = Re (z), \\Im z = Im (z)$.\n\nCan also use a polar view instead of the $\\Re z + \\Im zi = x + yi$\nClearly, $x = r \\cos\\theta, y = r \\sin\\theta$\nThen $x + yi = r(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)$\n\nWe can find that $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$ by expanding the Taylor series and recognizing $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ buried in the $e$ series. This is Euler's formula.\n\nThen clearly $x + yi = re^{i\\theta}$\n\nWe can use this to make some things easier, like $(1+i)^5$, which is $(\\sqrt2 e^{i\\frac\\pi4})^5 = {\\sqrt2}^5 e^{i5\\frac\\pi4}$.\n\nFurther, $r_1e^{i\\theta_1} \\times r_2e^{i\\theta_2} = r_1r_2e^{i(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2)}$\n\nMultiplying any two complex numbers $z_1,z_2$ together requires that they be in the same coordinate system. That is, they must both take the form $re^{i\\theta}$ or $x + yi$. Then it is straightforward.\n\nNow, what about $(1+i)^{(1+i)}$?\nWell, $1 + i = \\sqrt2e^{i\\frac\\pi4}$, so the whole things becomes ${\\sqrt2e^{(i\\frac\\pi4)}}^{(1+i)}$ which is trivial to finish. A further simplication is required; namely, $\\sqrt2 = e^{\\log\\sqrt2}$\n\nAnd that's all we need! If, in solving the above ODE, we find $r_1,r_2 \\in \\mathbb{C}$, we simply procede as normal, but at the end we have a lot of simplifying, expanding, and cancelling to do to find a solution that contains only real-valued functions and real coefficients."
