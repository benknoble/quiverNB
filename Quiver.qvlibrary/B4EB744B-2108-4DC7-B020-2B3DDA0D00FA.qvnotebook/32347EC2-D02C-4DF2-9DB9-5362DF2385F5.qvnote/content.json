Similarly, $L[cy_1 + y_2] = L[cy_1] + L[y_2] = g$.\n\nWe can expand this to arbitrary $y_n, g_m$ such that $L[y] = g_1 + g_2 + \\dots + g_m, L[y_1 + y_2 + \\dots + y_n] = L[y]$ because some number of $y_i : 0 \\lt i \\lt n$ exist such that $L[y_i] = 0$, and $m$ $y_i$ exist such that $L[y_i] = g_i$.\n\nCf.
