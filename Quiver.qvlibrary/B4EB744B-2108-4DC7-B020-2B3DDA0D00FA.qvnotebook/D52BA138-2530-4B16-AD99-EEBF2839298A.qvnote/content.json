Then $$y(t) = c_1 e^{\\alpha t}\\cos{\\beta t} + c_2 e^{\\alpha t}\\sin{\\beta t}$$ and we solve for $c_1,c_2$. See worksheet $\\#9$.\n\nFor $r = \\alpha$ is the only characteristic equation we find, we guess $y(t) = v(t)e^{rt}$, and use that to obtain another, hopefully simpler ODE. Remember to use the product rule for the derivatives.\n$$y' = re^{rt}v + e^{rt}v'$$\n$$y'' = r^2 e^{rt}v + 2re^{rt}v' + e^{rt}v''$$\nSubstitute in the ODE and simplify. Factoring typically yields a simpler equation in $v$, which we can use to complete the fundamental set.\n\nFor example, if $v'' = 0$, then $v(t) = A + Bt$.\nNow, $y_1 = e^{rt}, y_2 = Bte^{rt}$. We could use $y_2 = Ae^{rt} + Bte^{rt}$, but $Ae^{rt}$ provides no new information. We can eliminate it.\n\nBasically, this always works out such that if $r_1 = r_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $y(t) = c_1 e^{r_1t} + c_2 t e^{r_2t}$\n\nWe have exhausted the possibilities for solving $y'' + ay' + by = 0$.\nNow, $y'' + ay' + by = g(t)$!\n\nFind a solution by guessing...\n\nEx. $y'' + 4y' + 4y = e^{3t}$\nGuess $y(t) = Ae^{3t}$\nSubstituting gives $$9Ae^{3t} + 12Ae^{3t} + 4Ae^{3t} = e^{3t} \\iff (9 + 12 + 4)A = 1 \\iff A = \\frac 1 {25}$$\nThen $y(t) = \\frac 1 {25} e^{3t}$ solves the ODE, but does not meet arbitrary intial conditions. We call this $y_s(t)$ the specific solution.\nGoing back to $L[y] = y'' + 4y' + 4y$, we found that $L\\left[\\frac 1 {25} e^{3t}\\right] = e^{3t}$.\nThe trick is that $$L[c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 + y_s] = c_1L[y_1] + c_2L[y_2] + L[y_s] = e^{3t}$$\nIn other words, we can add any homogeneous solution to $y_s$ to produce a solution.\n\nIf $w_1(t), w_2(t)$ solve $y'' + ay' + by = g(t)$, then $$(w_1-w_2)'' + a(w_1-w_2)' + b(w_1-w_2) = 0$$"
