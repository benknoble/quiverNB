Now we need to use $y_0 = y(t_0), y'_0 = y'(t_0)$ as an IVP.\nExample: $y_0 = 2, y'_0 = 3$\nWell, $y_1(0) = 1, y'_1(0) = -2$, and $y_2(0) = 1, y'_2(0) = -3$. Neither equation has the desired properties.\n\nConsider adding a function $w$ to $y$, giving\n$$y'' + 5y' + 6y + w'' + 5w' + 6w$$\nbecause\n$$L[y] = y'' + 5y' + 6y$$\nwhere $L$ is the linear differential equation operator, and clearly\n$$L[y + w] = L[y] + L[w]$$\nAdditonally, multiplying $y$ by a constant $c$ results in\n$$L[cy] = cL[y]$$\nHow is this useful? Well$\\dots$\n\n$L[y_1] = 0$ and $L[y_2] = 0$ and $\\therefore L[c_1y_1 + c_2y_2] = 0$\nso $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ is a solution $\\forall c_1,c_2$\n\nFind $c_1,c_2$ such that $$(c_1y_1 + c_2y_2)(0) = 2$$ and $$(c_1y'_1 + c_2y'_2)(0) = 3$$\nSolve the system using matrices.\nClearly, we have $$c_1y_1(0) + c_2y_2(0) = 2$$ and $$c_1y'_1(0) + c_2y'_2(0) = 3$$\n\nWe have the matrices\n$$\\left[\\begin{matrix} y_1(0) & y_2(0) \\\\ y'_1(0) & y'_2(0) \\end{matrix}\\right] \\left[\\begin{matrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{matrix}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{matrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{matrix}\\right]$$\nwhich is obviously\n$$\\left[\\begin{matrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -3 \\end{matrix}\\right] \\left[\\begin{matrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{matrix}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{matrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{matrix}\\right]$$\nwhich, using matrix division (inversion and multiplication) to arrive at the identity matrix, we find\n$$c_1 = 9, c_2 = -7$$\nThis means that the full solution is\n$$y(t) = 9e^{-2t} - 7e^{-3t}$$\n\nFor (non-constant coefficient) equations like $t^2 y'' - 2y = 0$, guess $y(t) = t^p$ and procede as before to arrive at two solutions $y_1(t)$ and $y_2(t)$. Then you can combine them to solve the IVP using the Wronskian $W$ for the pair.\n\nThe Wronskian $W$ is computed by\n$$\\det \\left[\\begin{matrix} y_1 & y_2 \\\\ y'_1 & y'_2 \\end{matrix}\\right]$$\nand actually extends to more dimensions. It is also $W(f,g) = fg' - gf'$.\n\nWhat is its use? If $W(t_0) = 0$ for some $t_0$ (obtained from the IVP and computed by definition of Wronskian), there is no solution to the equation using $y_1$ and $y_2$ because the inverse matrix $A^{-1}$ is undefined. Primarly, you can use it to find values of $t_0$ for which you can solve an IVP with the particular $y_1$ and $y_2$ you have."
