We can also use parallax/angular shift.\n\nLooks like something is missing based on observed data...\nWe're assuming the planet absorbs all the light, heats up, and re-emits it.\nBut it may reflect some sunlight\n\nA planet's albedo $A$ represents the fraction of reflected light $\\in [0,1]$\n\n$T_{planet} = T_{sun}{(1-A)}^\\frac{1}{4}\\sqrt{\\frac{r_{sun}}{2d}}$"
