This stretches the moon slightly. It also changes *how* stretched out Io is, depending on whether it is at the aphelion or perihelion\n\nThis heats up Io in a process called tidal heating\n\nLarger eccentricity means more elliptical orbit, which means more tidal heating\nLarger orbits mean less tidal heating\nLarger diameter means more mass means more gravity means more tidal heating\n\nVenus probably went through a runaway greenhouse effect\n\nIf Venus started with water:\nMore of Venus’s water evaporates.\nVenus’s water must travel higher in its atmosphere before it can condense into rain (>100 km vs. 9-15 km on Earth). \nAt these heights, H2O is broken into 2 H and 1 O by UV sunlight.\nVenus does not exert a strong enough gravitational force on H atoms to prevent them from escaping into space. \nAs H atoms escape into space, Venus loses water.\nWithout rain, CO2 that is outgassed by volcanoes remains in the atmosphere.\nAs CO2 levels rise, Venus gets hotter, more water evaporates, and more H is lost to space, making rain even less frequent."
