This stretches the moon slightly. It also changes *how* stretched out Io is, depending on whether it is at the aphelion or perihelion\n\nThis heats up Io in a process called tidal heating\n\nLarger eccentricity means more elliptical orbit, which means more tidal heating\nLarger orbits mean less tidal heating\nLarger diameter means more mass means more gravity means more tidal heating\n\nVenus probably went through a runaway greenhouse effect\n\nREMINDER TO DOUBLE CHECK PPT"
