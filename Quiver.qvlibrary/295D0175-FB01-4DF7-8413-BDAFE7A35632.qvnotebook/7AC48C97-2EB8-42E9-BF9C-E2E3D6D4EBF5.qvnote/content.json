Further, we then know that the span of the column space of $S$ is \"full\"; that is, $rank(S) = m$ and $null(S) = \\{0\\}$. Finally, we know that we can row-reduce $S$ to be $I_m$, so $S \\sim I_m$. This is easy to show, since $S$'s linearly independent columns must form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^m$, and the easiest such basis $\\matrixstart e_1 \\dots e_m \\matrixend$ is equivalent.\n\nNow, $A = S \\cdot B \\sim I_m \\cdot B = B$, so $A \\sim B$ and therefore they have the same rank (the column space and row space are equivalent). $\\square$\n\nI have neither given nor recieved any aid on this assignment: David Ben Knoble.\nI verify that this is my own intellectual work: David Ben Knoble."
