Contradiction.\n\nOne fashion of examining linear independence is the same as earlier $c_1p_1 + c_2p_2 + c_3p_3 = 0$\nOur vectors are just $p_i \\in \\mathbb{P}_n$\n\nTo impose a coordinate structure on polynomials, we use a slight (but intuitive) trick of notation\n\n$v_1,\\dots, v_k \\in V$ are linearly independent $\\iff$ $[v_1], \\dots, [v_k] \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ are linearly independent\n\nCoordinates of linear transformations (see wksht. 21)"
