But we can keep things in the real plane with a trick.\nWe know that the entire thing must be real when you finish the multiplications, but that's a lot of computation.\n\nWe let $P = \\matrixstart u & v \\matrixend, D = \\matrixstart a & b \\\\ -b & a \\matrixend$\nThen $A = PDP^{-1}$\n\nBecause $e^{(a + ib)t} = e^{at}(\\cos(bt) + i\\sin(bt)$,\n$e^{At} = e^{at} P R(bt) P^{-1}$"
