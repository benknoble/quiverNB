Keep track of the row operations.\nThen we can pull out the row operations that generate the the equivalent rows.\n\nThe ones that equal $0$ help you identify linear dependencies, which allows you to identify redundancies and further pull out a span for the row space.\n\nThe augmented side will basically be in lower triangular form\n\nColumn and Row space have same number of basis vectors\n\nSwapping makes things messy\n\n$S$ is a subspace of $D^n$ where $D$ is some vector space\n$S = span(u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_m), m \\leq n$\n$S$ is a subset of $D^n$ that acts like a space on its own\n\nRule: Every subspace $\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ has a basis (i.e., is a span of vectors)\n\nUnique number of basis vectors that spans the subspace, and that defines the dimension\n\n$rank(A) :=$ dimension of row/column space\n$rank(A) :=$ is number of leading 1s (pivot)\n$nullity(A) :=$ dimension of null space of $A$\n\n$rank(A) + nullity(A) = cols(A)$, since the free variables in $rref(A)$ show up in the span of $ker(T) = null(A)$"
